# Wordle

This app is a clone of the popular game wordle. The state of an ongoing game is saved on quitting the app and loaded automatically on starting the app. The app has no separate users for now, as it is not necessary for this manner of app, though they could potentially be implemented if there is sufficent time.

## About Python version

This app has been tested on Python 3.9. Different versions may cause issues.
